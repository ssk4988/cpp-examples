# About
This is a repository where I create small examples to test different C++ concepts and ideas to gain a better understanding of the language.

#### Things I've tested
- Lambda Functions
- Polymorphism Through Inheritance
- Virtual and Pure Virtual Functions
- Multiple Inheritance
- Parallel Programs (such as a parallel prime sieve)
- Exception Handling
